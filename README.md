# Backend server for vue.js training

This is the back-end API to run locally for the [Vue.js training session](https://github.com/worldline/vuejs-training)

## Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# start the server
$ npm run start
```

You will need an OMDB API key to get movies results. If you don't have an API key, mocked responses will be used instead.

## Documentation

The swagger documentation is available on the `/api-docs` route.

Note: You can remove all users from the database with the endpoint `DELETE /users`.
